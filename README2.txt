To re-add your mod to your home computer:

Install Eclipse.
Setup the JDK path.
Install Forge.
Setup Forge.
Move the main folder from your USB into the 'Src' folder in the folder where you extracted all the forge files.
Now when you start-up eclipse, for selecting a workspace, make sure to choose the eclipse folder in wherever you extracted the forge files.

P.S. The instructions for installing eclipse, JDK, and Forge can be found on iDGamePlan in the first couple of modules.
